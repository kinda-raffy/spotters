### Params

- `voc_file`: path to vocabulary file required by ORB-SLAM3
- `settings_file`: path to settings file required by ORB-SLAM3
- `enable_pangolin`: enable/disable ORB-SLAM3's Pangolin viewer and interface. (`true` by default)

### Services

- `rosservice call /orb_slam3/save_map [file_name]`: save the map as `[file_name].osa` in `ROS_HOME` folder.
- `rosservice call /orb_slam3/save_traj [file_name]`: save the estimated trajectory of camera and keyframes as `[file_name]_cam_traj.txt` and  `[file_name]_kf_traj.txt` in `ROS_HOME` folder.


### Saving and loading the map

The map file will have `.osa` extension, and is located in the `ROS_HOME` folder (`~/.ros/` by default).

#### Load map

- Set the name of the map file to be loaded with `System.LoadAtlasFromFile` param in the settings file (`.yaml`).
- If the map file is not available, `System.LoadAtlasFromFile` param should be commented out otherwise there will be error.

#### Save map

- **Option 1**: If `System.SaveAtlasToFile` is set in the settings file, the map file will be automatically saved when you kill the ros node.
- **Option 2**: You can also call the following ros service at the end of the session

```bash
rosservice call /orb_slam3/save_map [file_name]
```
